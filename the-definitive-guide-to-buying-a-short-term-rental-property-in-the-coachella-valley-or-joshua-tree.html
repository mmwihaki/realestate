                                So you’ve decided to buy a home in the Coachella Valley. Like most other buyers, you plan to enjoy the desert sun and poolside cocktails when you can, while giving others the opportunity to do the same when you’re away. When thinking about how you will monetize your home, concerns about how long guests can stay begin to creep in your mind, intensified by the headache of attempting to understand the in’s and outs of the constantly changing legal landscape of the short term rental industry. </p>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">
                                            OA Real Estate Group recognizes how challenging this process may be and we wanted to offer our extensive knowledge to help guide you through purchasing a home while hopefully alleviating some of those stressful concerns. The below content is meant to highlight the pros and cons of buying a home in the desert. Through this blog.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black; font-weight: bold; ">
                                This article was written in November, 2020. Things do change in the short term rental industry, so please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:philip@oarealestategroup.com?subject=Requesting%20More%20Information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">philip@oarealestategroup.com</a>, as things may have changed since this article was written.  </p>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">
                                Below, you will find our definitive list of the best areas to look when buying a home in The Coachella Valley, focusing on the short term rental regulations for each. We are putting this in order of least restrictive to most challenging.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">
                                Though important, we don’t recommend banking your decision on the regulations implemented in your neighborhood. We believe you should always buy a home in an area you love, one that you can see yourself and your family in for years to come. Our recommendations therefore are meant to advise you about the restrictions associated with each area.  </p>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">
                                            We partner with Open Air Homes who specifically specializes in extended stay rentals over 30 days. In most cities, 30+ day stays are considered long term rentals, and with the future of travel aligning with this trend, you can expect to rent your home out for 30-90 day stints throughout the Coachella Valley.  </p>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">
                                Lastly, each city levies it’s own Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT tax). Cities around the world have levied their own TOT tax, similar to what hotels charge when you stay the night. Many cities have now become reliant on the income from these taxes, which often equate to millions of dollars that can visibly be seen as contributing to vibrancy of the community. Palm Springs, for example, has become reliant on these TOT taxes to tackle a number of initiatives, and while we wanted to include the TOT taxes that each city charges guests in your home, we believe that these TOT taxes are the short term rental industry’s way to contribute to the community.

                                       San Bernardino County imposes a 7% Transient Occupancy Tax on amounts paid by guests for occupancies that last 30 or fewer days

                                       You'll need to apply for a Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate to collect the tax. The county tax office mails a form to every active certificate holder each quarter.

                                Ok, ok, Joshua Tree is in San Bernardino and not in the Coachella Valley. But we believe we’d be doing you a disservice if we did not highlight one of the most visited desert landscapes in the nation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">
                                Joshua Tree is the youngest community on the list, and has generally been pretty open minded to the expansion of short term rentals in the community. With more space and less density, rentals in Joshua Tree are booming beyond just popular, but coveted vacation spots.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content-d" style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">
                                <strong>Our recommendation</strong> is to find a home that you love that is on the outskirts of the town, away from neighbors. Guests venturing to JTree are most likely wanting a retreat, a little sanctuary if you will that motivates them to disengage from their hectic lives in the city. With that in mind, they will prefer to stay off the beaten path. Look for properties where nature walks, stargazing and outdoor experiences can happen without interruption from the outside world - in this case that means even your Josua Tree neighbors.

                                Palm Springs is known for its abundance of mid-century, modern homes, reminiscent of an era that has been preserved throughout the city. Celebrities like Elvis, Frank Sinatra, Sunny & Cher, Marilyn Monroe and many more have vacationed or own a property in the area. Beyond its aesthetic, the city is famous for its art scene, cultural diversity and vibrant community. Boutique hotels and stand-alone restaurants dominate the landscape, maintaining the close relationships Palm Springs motivates guests and locals to create. For hiking enthusiasts, the Indian and Tahquitz canyons are a must see, while the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, taking you to the summit of Mt. San Jancito, will give clothes a breathtaking view of the entire Valley. The city has become a year around home for city dwellers searching for more space and more outdoor fun.

                                Just a short drive from Palm Springs to the east you will find Cathedral City, home to CVRep (Coachella Valley Repertory) and the new Agua Caliente Casino that has just opened its doors. This city has become a destination for the artist particularly Cathedral Canyon Cove, where you still can find affordable priced homes tucked away, surrounded by mountains.

                                Our partners at Open Air Homes believe that regulation is positive for the short term rental community. They are committed to being good neighbors through implementing policies and marketing practices that cater to longer term, respectful guests.

                                While some think that the Palm Springs regulations make it unattractive, we believe in a future that allows for both short term rentals, long term rentals and hotels to coexist in neighborhoods. While there are rules and fines when guests break the rules, these regulations have been put in place to keep the peace in the community. 
                            </p>

                                Palm Springs is and will always be the quintessential embodiment of California desert living. From the great restaurants to the lively downtown area, we believe that Palm Springs is now and will continue to be one of the best places to start your home owning experience in the desert.

                                <strong>Our recommendation</strong> is to find a family friendly home that can be marketed towards families looking for extended stays, as opposed to weekend party groups. Think more board games than beer pong tables. As we are seeing a huge uptick in 30-90 day rentals, consider renting out your home for an extended period, which will inevitably reduce the overall wear and tear of the home. But, if you design your home well and price it correctly, you will receive high occupancy rates, regardless of if you do shorter stays or longer stays.

                                The city is quieter, and the city council recently paused new permits for short term rentals. However, Open Air Homes continues to manage homes in the area that are 31+ day rentals, and they have been renting well.

                                <strong>Palm Desert</strong> is known for having great golf courses and less restrictions on short term rentals. A number of HOAs, in an effort to be more competitive in a crowded marketplace, also allow short term rentals.

                                Guests who come to Palm Desert like that the city is centrally located, with some incredible golf courses that only add to the location's value. Home to El Paseo, considered the Rodeo drive of the desert, and the Living Desert, a beautiful safari like zoo off the 74 highway, this area has unprecedented opportunities for fun in the sun when not in a pool. Palm Desert’s looser rental regulations make it a great place to consider for shorter stays.

                                <strong>Rancho Mirage</strong> unfortunately voted to ban short term rentals (any stay longer than 27 days) this past year. This ban should be a clear indication that the industry has been allowed to operate for far too long without restrictions. While we believe that with the right restrictions in place that short term rental neighbors can peacefully coexist with long term neighbors, the city council took some pretty serious measures in restoring some night time quiet. Open Air Homes is committed to being good neighbors and takes every possible step to ensure that our guests respect the community they are in. Read about Open Air Homes’ Good Neighbor Pledge.

                                We absolutely love Rancho Mirage and believe that there are a lot of great homes built by inspiring architects. While the ban on short term rentals may seem harsh and could lower home prices, as a lot of homeowners relied on the monetization of their home, our partners at Open Air Homes have the 30+ day rentals experience to assist your search if Rancho Mirage is where you want to be.

                                Indio can be found in the easternmost region of the Coachella Valley. Indio has become known for the world famous Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals held on the Polo grounds. Indio is also known for its large retirement community and great golf courses. Indio is one of more relaxed cities in The Coachella Valley when it comes to short-term rentals. Despite the busy activity during festival time, we recommend considering one of the other cities in Coachella valley for your short-term rental due to its proximity to attractions and activities for visitors.

                                Just a short drive from Palm Springs to the east you will find Cathedral City, home to CVRep (Coachella Valley Repertory) and the new Agua Caliente Casino that has just opened its doors. This city has become a destination for the artist particularly Cathedral Canyon Cove, where you still can find affordable priced homes tucked away, surrounded by mountains.

                                <strong>Indian Wells</strong> is probably the most restrictive when it comes to short term rentals. Some HOAs have their own rules that allow it, but most do not. Most homes will need to be rented out a minimum of 29 nights.

                                When it comes to Desert Hot Springs the name really tells it all, the city is known for its many natural hot and cold mineral springs, and has more than a dozen natural mineral springs lodgings in town. When buying a short-term rental here make sure to purchase in a gate community as those homes are the most desirable. However, because of it’s distance to attractions and activities and its location in a high wind zone, you might consider one of the other cities in Coachella valley for your short-term rental.

                                Coachella is a pretty rural part in the easternmost region of the Coachella Valley and borders Indio which is known for the world famous Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals held on the Polo grounds. There you can find the Coachella walls, considered the city’s best kept secret, beautiful murals and paintings that line the downtown area celebrating its history and people. There aren’t a lot of homes located here and you will find many agricultural farms because of its vast rural areas. Despite the busy activity during festival time, we recommend considering one of the other cities in Coachella valley for your short-term rental due to its proximity to attractions and activities for visitors.
