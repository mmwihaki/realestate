            <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">Investment properties are a great source of income for people
              who are
              looking to find a strong rate of return on investment. Although long-term leasing has always been an
              option, many people are utilizing short-term rentals to maximize
              their income potential as you can achieve higher rental rates. The short-term rental market is thriving
              and bookings have exploded in areas like Los Angeles and Palm Springs, a draw for people in search of nice
              weather. With a lot of
              people permanently working from home due to Covid and others looking to get away from life as usual, this
              market continues to expand. Our real estate team is not only trained in finding one's primary residence
              but also in identifying
              the perfect investment property for short/long-term rentals. While we focus on bringing you the long-term
              rental rates, our partnership with Open Air Homes, a full service boutique short-term rental company
              allows us to obtain the most
              accurate rates on the short-term side. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">The partnership between the two is seamless as once a property
              is identified
              by the OA Real Estate Group, Open Air Homes steps in to show you the potential short-term rental value
              along with a full design team standing by for any
              modifications that might need to be made to improve the income potential. Contact us today for a free

                  He connected me to a loan officer who was very helpful in handling the entire operation. Once that was
                  done, he made sure to walk me through each and every step of the being a buyer and a seller and

                    My husband and I took a weekend trip to Ventura and were so impressed with the beauty, weather, and
                    vibe that we decided to move from LA to the beach. A friend recommended we hire Austin Victoria as
                    our agent. I was reluctant because he is young and handsome and looks more like an actor than a
                    serious real estate agent. But during the interview he proved to be very knowledgeable, so we signed
                    the contract. We listed our house for sale and had a full price offer in the first week! The more
                    difficult task was finding the right house in Ventura. The market is so strong we knew it would be
                    difficult. We put offers on 3 houses before getting our dream house. All of this happened in 2
                    weeks! We had closed and moved in within 4 weeks! And the best part of all is that Austin explained
                    how with proposition 90 we could keep our same tax basis even though our house value had almost
                    doubled. None of this would have been possible without Austin’s hard work and determination. Thank
                    you Austin!

                    My experience with Austin was a very good one. He was professional, detailed, and genuinely caring
                    about my needs and wants. Austin was honest and paid attention to every detail. He was easily
                    reachable and very professional. I would highly recommend him. My house sold the first week on the
                    market for more than I was asking. Won’t hesitate to use him again.
